## Description
This branch deals with Collaborative Filtering approach on recommending books for user.

### Dataset

We make use of GoodReads Dataset available on [UCSD Book Graph](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home). 

### Before you begin

- Download [Complete Book Graph](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LXpK1UfqtP89H1tYy0pBGHjYk8IhigUK) and save it inside `./data/` folder in root directory
- Download [Book IDs](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CHTAaNwyzvbi1TR08MJrJ03BxA266Yxr) and [Complete User-Book Interactions.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zmylV7XW2dfQVCLeg1LbllfQtHD2KUon) in the same folder

- To run the model alone run Book_Recommendation.ipynb
- To run the evaluation alone run eval_colab.ipynb
- To run the both together run Model_eval.ipynb

Some parts of the code has been adapted from [VikParuchuri](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-walkthroughs/tree/master/books)
